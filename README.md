# Predicting-the-Severity-of-Periodontitis-with-Obesity-Data
The dataset I selected is titled "Raw Data on the Effects of Obesity on the Risk and Severity of Periodontitis." It was originally collected by Universitas Indonesia and is stored in the Harvard Dataverse. The dataset contains variables related to demographics, health status, and oral health, such as BMI, age, sex, clinical attachment loss (CAL), and more.

Periodontitis is a serious but preventable gum infection that damages the soft tissue and can destroy the bone that supports the teeth. Periodontitis can cause teeth to loosen or result in tooth loss. The bacteria responsible for periodontitis can enter the bloodstream through gum tissue, potentially affecting other parts of the body and causing respiratory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, and issues with blood sugar control in diabetes. Common risk factors for chronic periodontitis include smoking, alcohol consumption, oral hygiene, and obesity.

The project's goal is to predict the severity of periodontitis based on potential risk factors, such as age, BMI, blood pressure, dental hygiene, and more.

Predictive modeling, including Na√Øve Bayes, decision tree, and RIPPER algorithms, was used to make the prediction.
